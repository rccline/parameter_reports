# Example of parameterized Reports using Rmarkdown.  

Rmarkdown document is created and is knitted from an external R-script.  

The data source for the Rmarkdown document consists of two tables from two differnt MS Excel files.  The first excel file is a record of the Land Owners.  The second record source is a list of each owner's tracts of land.

The relationship between the land owner records and the tracts files is a *one to many*.   

Each land owner's report has a list of the land owner's tracts published in a table format.
